# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

A list of resources will be published shortly for how to contribute to the project.

## Testing

This section will be written shortly! For now, manual testing of the API is needed.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to opengovernment](https://github.com/Ashthetik/CICWE/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -S -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability and secuity:

  * We indent using four spaces (hard or soft tabs)
  * All commits must be signed, either over web, SSH, or GPG. Any commits as of `2025-04-23T03:38:09Z` that are not signed will not be accepted*. Pull Requests, included.
  * We avoid logic in views, putting HTML generators into helpers
  * Use correct commenting styles, multi-line should use `/** */` and should concisely describe *__why__* it works, avoid explaining the what it does unless the method may appear obscure.
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
  * When writing API responses, a DTO for it's correlating format can be found in [the Utility](src/utility/dto.ts) folder.
  * We use strong typing, so ensure that all variables, functions, etc. are using the correct explicit type (`const example: string = "asdf";`, `... async (req: Request, res: Response) ...`).

\* Setting up commit signing can be found can be under GitHub's [Signing Commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) documentation.

## Practising Secure Coding:  

While we acknowledge readability, there are cases where we apply security standards that may lead to obscure code.
In such cases, the standards applied are as followed and may reference [OWASP ASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/):

### Threat Matrix
Our current working threat matrix is defined as below, and may be subject to change


| **Threat**                                                      | **Risk Description**                                                                                                          | **Mitigation/Control**                                                                                                                                                                    | **ASVS Reference**              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **1. Obscured Readability Due to Security Practices**            | Security measures may lead to code that is harder to read or understand, which can increase the chances of security flaws.      | - Maintain balance between readability and security standards.                                                                                                                            | - OWASP ASVS: General Practice  |
| **2. Unnecessary Supply Chain Dependencies**                      | Overuse of libraries for simple methods increases the attack surface due to more dependencies and potential vulnerabilities.     | - Avoid installing external libraries for simple tasks.                                                                                                                                    | - OWASP ASVS: General Practice  |
| **3. Insufficient Input and Output Handling**                    | Failure to clearly define how to handle data input and output may lead to unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities.             | - Ensure input/output handling is defined by type, content, and relevant laws/policies.                                                                                                    | - ASVS 4.0.3, 1.5.1             |
| **4. Deserialization Vulnerabilities**                            | Using serialization with untrusted clients can open the application to attacks like object injection and deserialization flaws. | - Avoid serialization with untrusted clients. - Implement integrity controls, encryption, and proper validation when serialization is necessary.                                            | - ASVS 4.0.3, 1.5.2             |
| **5. Lack of Input Validation on Trusted Service Layer**         | Failing to enforce input validation at the service layer may result in improper data processing, leading to injection attacks.  | - Enforce robust input validation on trusted service layers.                                                                                                                               | - ASVS 4.0.3, 1.5.3             |
| **6. Inconsistent or Poor Logging Practices**                    | Improper or inconsistent logging may obscure security incidents or make them harder to detect.                                | - Implement a standardized logging format and consistent approach across the system.                                                                                                        | - ASVS 4.0.3, 1.7.1             |
| **7. Outdated/Insecure Components in Build Pipeline**            | The presence of outdated, insecure, or vulnerable components can introduce new risks to the application.                       | - Set up warnings in the build pipeline for out-of-date or insecure components and take immediate corrective action.                                                                         | - ASVS 4.0.3, 1.14.3            |
| **8. Use of Unsupported or Insecure Client-Side Technologies**   | Use of deprecated or insecure client-side technologies can introduce vulnerabilities or make the system incompatible.          | - Ensure that the application does not use unsupported, insecure, or deprecated client-side technologies (e.g., Flash, ActiveX, Java applets).                                              | - ASVS 4.0.3, 1.14.6            |

### Key Notes for Secure Coding:
- **Input Validation**: Always validate input on the trusted service layer to prevent attacks like SQL injection, XSS, etc. Input validation must consider the type, content, and specific laws/regulations that apply.
- **Serialization Integrity**: Avoid using serialization for communication with untrusted clients. If unavoidable, ensure the integrity and confidentiality of serialized data.
- **Library Dependency**: Use libraries only when necessary, and avoid bloating the application with unnecessary dependencies to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Use consistent and structured logging to monitor activities and catch security incidents early.
- **Build Pipeline Security**: Ensure the build pipeline detects and flags outdated or insecure components before they are deployed into production.
- **Client-Side Technologies**: Regularly audit client-side technologies to ensure they are up-to-date and secure, and avoid deprecated or insecure components.
